## Demo

Look at this fizzBuzz program. A lot of people are saying and I mean a lot that it is the best fizzBuzz they have ever seen. Believe me.

fizzBuzz.covfefe

```
MAKE_IT_BIG fizzBuzz(n) {
  KEEP_WINNING LOOK x IS 0! x < n! x += 1 {
    BELIEVE_ME x % 5 == 0 AND x % 3 == 0 {
      BING("fizzBuzz")!
    } BUT_MAYBE x % 3 == 0 {
      BING("fizz")!
    } BUT_MAYBE x % 5 == 0 {
      BING("buzz")!
    } FAKE_NEWS {
      BING(x)!
    }
  }
}

fizzBuzz(100)!
```

## Features

- Turing complete, it can do anything. Anything. Some people are saying it's the most complete language.
- Built with Go, it's the best language, very best.
- Freedom included, believe me.

## Usage

Running CovfefeScript is very simple. The simplest.

You can build it yourself like a winner.

```
// First, you build the interpreter, a strong interpreter.
go build

// Then, run your beautiful code. You'll love it. Believe me.
./covfefescript big_hands.covfefe
```

Or use NPM. Sad.

```
npm install -g covfefescript
```

## Syntax

A lot of people are saying we have the best syntax.

### Statement Terminator

All real statements, the ones that do things, must end with an exclamation point (!). It shows strength. It's not optional. We don't do optional.

### Comments

Sometimes you have to deal with fake news from the media. You can put it in comments.

```
// This is fake news. You know it. I know it.
// Everybody knows it.

FAKE_CODE
  This code? Totally fake.
  Nobody even runs this stuff.
  It's just here to confuse the losers and haters.
SAD

```

### Variables

You declare variables with LOOK. It's how you find the truth. There are many great types of variables. These are just labels, by the way, not keywords. The language knows the type. It's very smart.

```
// TWEET (string)
LOOK economy IS "booming"!

// MONEY (number)
LOOK small_loan IS 1000000!

// TRUTH (boolean)
LOOK my_hater IS LOSER! // This is false, obviously.
LOOK my_hand IS YUGE! // This is true.

// COVFEFE (null)
LOOK empty_val IS COVFEFE!

// COLLUTION (array)
LOOK my_team IS [ "the best", "people", "a beautiful wall" ]!

// PROPERTY (object)
LOOK my_deal IS {
  "name": "The Art of the Deal",
  "rating": "tremendous"
}!

```

### Conditionals

Use BELIEVE_ME for an if statement. If that's not true, try BUT_MAYBE (else if). Everything else is FAKE_NEWS (else). Sad!

```
LOOK your_breath IS "good"!

BELIEVE_ME your_breath == "good" {
  BING("It's the best breath, very best.")!
} BUT_MAYBE your_breath != "good" {
  BING("Do you mind if I sit back a little? ")!
} FAKE_NEWS {
  SADLY("Because your breath is very bad.")!
}
```

Just like the other language, you can use AND and OR, I know it, you know it.

### Loops

You use KEEP_WINNING to start a loop. It's a C-style loop because it's a winning style. The best style.

```
KEEP_WINNING LOOK i IS 0! i < 5! i += 1 {
  BELIEVE_ME i == 2 {
    IT_WAS_RIGGED! // break
  }

  BELIEVE_ME i == 0 {
    TIRED_OF_WINNING // continue
  }

  BING("The number is", i, "and it's a great number.")!
}
```

### Arithmetic

We have the best math, I love math, nobody does math like this.

```
LOOK a IS 5!
LOOK b IS 3!

LOOK sum IS a + b!
BING("5 + 3 =", sum)!

LOOK diff IS a - b!
BING("5 - 3 =", diff)!

LOOK prod IS a * b!
BING("5 * 3 =", prod)!

LOOK quotient IS a / b!
BING("5 / 3 =", quotient)!

LOOK rem IS a % b!
BING("5 % 3 =", rem)!

LOOK big_number_calc IS a + b * 2 - 1!
BING("Complex calc:", big_number_calc)!

```

### Functions

As you have probably guessed, you use MAKE_IT_BIG to start a function. It is so good, so simple. You use GIVE_ME to return a value.

```
MAKE_IT_BIG buildTheWall(height, material) {
  GIVE_ME "A " + height + " foot wall made of " + material + ". Beautiful."!
}

LOOK my_wall IS buildTheWall(30, "solid gold")!
BING(my_wall)!
```

We have the best built-ins. More are coming.

- BING(...)!: Prints to the console. Very powerful.
- SADLY(...)!: Prints an error message. Very sad.

## Attributions

This is the first programming language I've ever built.
It was built in around for Boot.dev Hackahton 2025.
Due to the time constraint, I took the simplest design: tree-walking interpreter, top-down (pratt) parser,

I heavily referenced the Thorsten Ball's Writing an Interpreter in Go and Crafting Interpreter.
